      "['General Insurance Code of Practice Setting out standards of conduct for the general insurers who have adopted the Code and their Employees, Distributors and Service Suppliers. On behalf of the Board of the Insurance Council of Australia, I am pleased to present this updated version of the General Insurance Code of Practice 2020, which came into effect on 5 October 2021. The industry understands the vital role it plays in the community and the economy and the General Insurance Code of Practice continues to set a benchmark for self-regulation in the financial services sector. The 2020 Code was developed by the industry in consultation with multiple stakeholders and the result is the most customer-focused Code in its history, and one reflecting evolving community expectations. This includes a strong focus on supporting customers experiencing vulnerability. Most of the 2020 Code started on 1 July 2021, however some obligations, such as having a publicly available family violence policy, and the Supporting Customers Experiencing Vulnerability and Financial Hardship parts, took effect earlier. As the Code is a living document, some adjustments have now been made in this October 2021 version to align with ASIC’s new guidelines for complaints handling. For example, a new', 'timeframe to resolve a complaint has been introduced reducing the time from 45 to 30 days. There is also a new commitment to promote improved awareness about the availability of Financial Hardship support on Code subscriber’s websites. The Code reflects the general insurance industry’s ongoing commitment to positive outcomes for consumers and its determination to provide best practice in conduct and customer service. I welcome the latest version of the 2020 Code and its ongoing improvements. Sue Houghton President Insurance Council of Australia 5 October 2021 President’s foreword 12Life can be unpredictable. Insurance can help protect you from life’s unpredictability. Some of the ways general insurance can protect you are: • for loss or damage to your valuable possessions — such as your home or car, or even your Small Businesses and infrastructure; • for your responsibility, or ‘liability’, to another person if you cause them loss or damage; and • for loss you suffer from certain events such as travel cancellation and many types of natural disasters. By helping you to manage the financial impact of insured events, insurance can help reduce your stress. Although insurance is important in your personal and business affairs, insurance — and the insurance', 'industry — underpin the Australian financial system. It does this by insuring risks for people and for the community and by helping them to rebuild and replace their assets after insured losses. Where a risk is not insured the burden of loss may have to be borne by the community. The insurance industry also contributes to improved risk management. To find out more about insurance, visit www.understandinsurance.com.au .The Code The General Insurance Code of Practice (the Code) was introduced in 1994 by the Insurance Council of Australia as a voluntary Code. It has been regularly reviewed and updated. The Code is independently monitored and enforced by the Code Governance Committee. The Code has been developed through consultation with a range of stakeholders including consumer and industry representatives, the Code Governance Committee, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The Code is intended to be a positive influence across all aspects of the general insurance industry including product disclosure, claims handling and investigations, relationships with people who are experiencing vulnerability, and reporting obligations. Meeting community needs, standards and expectations The general insurance industry is an integral part of an inclusive, thriving and adaptable community. The industry', 'must always strive to meet the community’s evolving expectations for how it should support individuals and small businesses. The Code is a key way the general insurance industry makes sure it continues: • to work towards this important goal; and • to provide value to you and the whole community.General insurance in our society 3fairness of products and servicestrust integrity respectinclusive value transparency accessibility and additional support resolve any concerns and work to prevent future concerns Our principles The principles that underpin the Code shape the way the general insurance industry behaves, treats people and approaches decision-making.
